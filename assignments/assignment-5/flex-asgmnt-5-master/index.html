                <p>Limes are small green citrus fruits that are very easy to recognize. The most common are Persian limes, also known as Bearss or Tahitian limes. Most of the world’s commercially grown lime trees are found in Mexico, the country that also consumes the most limes. Limes are used in cuisines throughout the world. 
                Though many people are familiar with bottled lime juice, using fresh limes can really make a difference in the flavor of your food and drinks. The good news is that limes are available in most markets year-round. There are some tricks you can use to select the best and juiciest limes. Plus, you’ll want to know 
                the various ways limes are used in recipes. Limes have a tart, acidic taste with just a slight hint of sweetness. They’re bright and vibrant, with a distinct zesty sour flavor, and their mouth-puckering bitterness is why they’re not eaten whole like an orange. At first glance, anyone can tell the difference between 
                a lime and a lemon. Where limes are small, round, and green, lemons are large, oval, and yellow. It’s important, however, to understand the flavor difference. </p></div>

                <p>As an excellent source of the antioxidant vitamin C, oranges may help combat the formation of free radicals that cause cancer.
                Although an adequate vitamin C intake is necessary and very beneficial, the amount a person would need for the desired therapeutic effect 
                on cancer is more than they could realistically consume. Oranges contain no sodium, which helps keep a person below their daily limit. On the other hand, 
                a cup of orange juice can boost daily potassium intake by 14%. Maintaining a low sodium intake is essential to lowering blood pressure. However, increasing potassium intake may be just as important for reducing a person’s risk. 
                Consuming enough vitamin C can help a person maintain skin health and appearance. Vitamin C contributes to collagen production. Collagen supports the skin, promotes wound healing, and improves skin strength.
                The outcome of a 2015 review suggests that dietary vitamin C improved how people perceived their skin health and how healthful it actually was, 
                including appearance, wrinkling, elasticity, and roughness. </p></div>

                <p>Bananas are among the most important food crops on the planet.
                They come from a family of plants called Musa that are native to Southeast Asia and grown in many of the warmer areas of the world.
                Bananas are a healthy source of fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and various antioxidants and phytonutrients.
                Many types and sizes exist. Their color usually ranges from green to yellow, but some varieties are red. Bananas are a rich source of carbs, which 
                occur mainly as starch in unripe bananas and sugars in ripe bananas. The carb composition of bananas changes drastically during ripening. The main 
                component of unripe bananas is starch. Green bananas contain up to 80% starch measured in dry weight. During ripening, the starch is converted into
                 sugars and ends up being less than 1% when the banana is fully ripe. Bananas are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, especially potassium, 
                vitamin B6, and vitamin C. A diet high in potassium can lower blood pressure in people with elevated levels and benefits heart health.</p></div>
            <div class="blueberries">

                <p>Blueberries bring forth a sense of nostalgia. They conjure memories of blue-stained hands from picking wild berries and blue-stained 
                tongues from popping every other one in our mouths. They remind us of the smell of homemade pies, scones, and muffins coming out of
                the oven in late summer. And they are proof that sometimes the best ingredients are the simple ones you can find right in your own backyard. 
                The wild blueberry is one of four berries native to North America, along with cranberries, blackberries, and raspberries. The domestication 
                of blueberries was achieved by two strangers who joined forces in the early 1900s. Frederick Coville, a botanist from the USDA, and 
                Elizabeth White, a cranberry farmer’s daughter from New Jersey, worked together to breed a commercial blueberry. Together, they 
                cross-pollinated hundreds of blueberry plants to find ones that produced high yields of large, sweet berries. By 1916, they had 
                found the perfect blueberry variety, the Rubel, which quickly made its way to farms across the country, adapting to new climates.</p></div>
